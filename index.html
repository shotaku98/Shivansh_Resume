									● Three different bionic flap geometries on a car were modeled in SolidWorks and
									then imported into Ansys Fluent for CFD analysis. The flow domain was created
									using enclosure and boolean. To reduce the computational power used, symmetry
									conditions were utilized. Appropriate mesh sizing involving body sizing and
									sphere of influence was used to mesh the model and the flow domain. Applicable
									boundary conditions were given along with setting up the right viscosity and
									velocity of the car.
									<br>● The turbulence model used was SST-kω and the speeds of tests were 50m/s
									and 100m/s (112 mph and 224 mph respectively). Following this, the solver
									criteria were set with residuals under 10e-6 for result accuracy. Report
									definitions for drag and lift (downforce) were created. The simulations were run
									for the various geometries. After the simulations, the designs were prototyped
									using a 3D printer with a fine surface finish and tested in the in-house wind
									tunnel at the university. Finally, the results achieved for the optimum geometry
									of bionic flaps were in congruence with the design that Mercedes has for their
									bionic flaps on the concept car- Vision AVTR, which was the inspiration for this
									project, thus validating this study.

									● A mini rocket was modeled in Siemens NX CAD/CAM software. The rocket design
									was split in half and the negative of the design was taken to be used in the
									mold. Drafts were given and uniform wall thickness was ensured with no sharp
									edges for even material flow and elimination of defects. The parts were
									assembled using dowels, predominantly built into the part itself to be attached
									with an interference fit. For the mold, a parting line was chosen in the center
									and the gate and runner location were decided keeping in mind the equal time of
									filling of plastic.
									<br>● Mold blocks were also designed in NX. 4 mold blocks were machined using
									the ptp file generated by the NX CAM Post-processing. This helped us generate,
									verify, and analyze the tool path on our molds, which was adjusted as per the
									need and the tool. Appropriate tool sizes were chosen and correct subsequent
									machining features were selected like the depth of cut, feed rate, stepover,
									number of flutes, rapid, spindle speed, RPM, etc. for the tools.
									The molds were then put into the injection molding machine. Hot molten ABS
									plastic was injected into the molds clamped under pressure in the IM machine and
									20 samples were produced. Finally, a metrology study was done on the
									manufactured samples to confirm that the part dimensional variation is under the

									● Designed and analyzed engine components, tools, fixtures, and workstations
									according to industry standards and company requirements. Designing tasks were
									majorly carried out in Autodesk Inventor and included product development from its
									initial design concept phase to releasing drawings to manufacturers with appropriate
									geometric dimensioning and tolerances and finally installation on production
									workstations.

									<br>● In one of the projects that dealt with the process of dowel pin pressing on
									fuel injector bodies produced at the plant, I eliminated internal defects and
									reduced customer complaints by redesigning the pressing tool and automating the
									process while providing a poka-yoke at the station. The project started with data
									collection on the workstation to understand the existing situation which was
									followed by root cause analysis (why-why analysis) and the tool was redesigned to
									eliminate the existing problem. As a poka-yoke, a buzzer was installed on the
									station and it would buzz every time any part with a missing dowel pin was passed
									through, and the tool would stop at the bottom position of the pneumatic press.
									Masters were provided for the operators to calibrate and ensure process uniformity.
									Apart from the tool, the fixtures were also redesigned for different part types. The
									tool and fixture drawings and the SOP were updated. FMEA was done on the newly built
									tool and the RPN was drastically brought down. Control measures included process and
									machine capability calculation and the part tolerance was maintained at all times
									with the new tool.
									<br>● Moreover, keeping pace with the fast-moving world, I also involved myself in
									projects related to digitalization. I started learning programming in Python,
									learned about IoT and AI, and started developing digital solutions for the plant
									including conditional monitoring of machines paired with real-time notifications for
									critical conditions, facial recognition for numerous applications in the plant, and
									visual inspection using computer vision based AI.

									● Worked on enhancing the aerodynamic performance of an airplane wing using Ansys
									Fluent to measure multi-feature implements on the wing body. I and the team looked
									at performance parameters to reduce the required thrust and save fuel during flight.
									The quantities of interest were lift and drag forces, their coefficients, and their
									ratios. The fuel reduction with the multi-feature implements was approximately 4%
									with the improved model. The optimized design was eventually patented by the
									company.

								● Worked with Prof. Uwe Apel on building a special-purpose hybrid model of an Airship
								for transporting goods to remote areas and Polar Regions. Created a model via
								performance analysis and optimized the model under field conditions. The hull and
								gondola designs were improved using Autodesk Fusion 360 while the aerodynamic
								optimization was done using CFD analysis on Ansys Fluent. An additional outer support
								structure for the hull for structural stability was designed and implemented using
								structural analysis and topology optimization for optimum results. Materials were
								appropriately selected.
								<br>● The electrical wiring concept was introduced which helped improve the flight
								stability and increased the payload capacity of the airship. The new rotors enabled a
								vertical takeoff. The combined effect of the new design and electronics was an increased
								payload capacity, to 200%. The model was analytically tested along with its
								documentation and analysis of aspects for future improvements.

								● Worked on CAD software, SolidWorks, and CATIA to design the model of the kart, chassis, body works, etc., and simulated them in Ansys. The kart was analyzed for optimum aerodynamics and other parts like knuckles, brake disks, etc. were analyzed for structural stability, thermal design, and vibrational and frictional losses. The crash impact testing was also performed using Ansys software. It demanded thorough training to properly utilize the software and I took the opportunity to learn it. Following the design finalization, DVP&R and FMEA were done for the whole kart and individual components. A cost report was prepared as well. The kart being an electric vehicle, I got educated on building electrical circuits, batteries, battery management systems (BMS), and the whole EV development process.

								<br>● Post this, the manufacturing of the kart was a time-consuming process. Working on everything from scratch, numerous manufacturing processes were utilized including CNC machining, 3D printing, casting, sheet metal forming, welding, grinding, drilling, and many more.
								The competition was a 4-day event at Kari Motor Speedway in Coimbatore, India, where we had the smallest team ever, yet we gave a tough competition to all the participating teams, gaining an overall 9th position, nationally.

								● One of the initial projects that I worked on dealt with the performance optimization and fabrication of a Solar Air Heater. The efficiency of the solar air heater was improved with enhancement in the system design. The fabrication and performance evaluation of a solar air heater with the inclusion of an arched wavy absorber plate, having porous aluminum wire mesh cylindrical fins attached, resulted in an increase in the air turbulence and vortex generation, which led to the breaking of laminar sub-layer near the surface of the absorber plate and improved the heat transfer. Cylindrical porous wire mesh aluminum fins resulted in an increase in the fin porosity which reduced the pressure drop and improved the thermal performance of the solar air heater.
								<br>● Post this, the manufacturing of the kart was a time-consuming process. Working on everything from scratch, numerous manufacturing processes were utilized including CNC machining, 3D printing, casting, sheet metal forming, welding, grinding, drilling, and many more.
								The new improved design with mesh in the heater chamber was designed in SolidWorks and CFD analysis was done in Ansys Fluent. The physical model of the air heater was fabricated and tested. The simulations and the values achieved on experimentation yielded great results. A research paper on this project was written and presented at the 7th International Conference on Power and Energy Systems Engineering (CPESE 2020) and has been published in the CPESE 2020 conference proceedings, Energy Reports by Elsevier. Another review paper was published on the thermal energy storage technology that was later introduced in the solar air heater for further improvement in energy efficiency and was published as a book chapter in Springer’s Advances in Clean Energy Technologies 2020.
